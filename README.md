<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The two MATLAB codes are designed to enable user-assisted automated quantification of actin filament properties using single-molecule micrographs. 
* The Filament Length Anlysis program is designed to quantify the lengths of individual Actin filaments present in the micrograph.
* The Bundle Analysis program is designed to quantify actin filament crosslinking in a time-lapse movie.


### Built With

* **MATLAB by MATHWORKS**


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To use the codes, the entire repository can be downloaded from the "code" dropdown menu. Please save them in an accessible location in your computer.

### Prerequisites

MATLAB by Mathworks needs to be installed and activated.
* Link to download MATLAB
  ```sh
  (https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/)
  ```
  
### Toolbox Installation

MATLAB needs to be configured with several add-on Toolboxes
1. Image Acquisition Toolbox
2. Image Processing Toolbox
3. Signal Processing Toolbox
4. Curve Fitting Toolbox

* To install add-ons, in MATLAB go to the home tab and in the Add-Ons dropdown menu click on "Get Add-Ons". Here you can search for specific toolboxes and install them.
