<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The two MATLAB codes are There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

MATLAB by Mathworks needs to be installed and activated.
* Link to download MATLAB
  ```sh
  https://login.mathworks.com/embedded-login/landing.html?cid=getmatlab
  ```
  
### Toolbox Installation

MATLAB needs to be configured with several add-on Toolboxes
1. Image Acquisition Toolbox
2. Image Processing Toolbox
3. Signal Processing Toolbox
4. Curve Fitting Toolbox

* To install add-ons, in MATLAB go to the home tab and click on "Get Add-Ons"
