<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The two MATLAB codes are designed to enable user-assisted automated quantification of actin filament properties using single-molecule micrographs. 
* The *Bundle Analysis* program is designed to quantify actin filament crosslinking in a time-lapse movie.
* The *Filament Length Quantification* program is designed to quantify the lengths of individual actin filaments present in the micrograph.

The work is supported by NIH and by the Genetics and Cell Biology department of University of Minnesota, Twin-cities.

### Built With

* **MATLAB by Mathworks**


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To use the codes, the entire repository can be downloaded from the "code" dropdown menu. Please save them in an accessible location in your computer.

### Prerequisites

MATLAB by Mathworks needs to be installed and activated.
* Link to download MATLAB - https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/
  
### Installation

MATLAB needs to be configured with several add-on Toolboxes
1. Image Acquisition Toolbox
2. Image Processing Toolbox
3. Signal Processing Toolbox
4. Curve Fitting Toolbox

* To install add-ons, in MATLAB go to the home tab and in the Add-Ons dropdown menu click on "Get Add-Ons". Here you can search for specific toolboxes and install them.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Use the sample images/movies to trial run the code in your system. To further fine tune the usage of these codes for your need, please go through the *User Manual*.
